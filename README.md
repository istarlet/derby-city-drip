## How to Run this Project

To run this project:

- `npm install` 
- `npm run dev` 

## Javascript Features
`1. Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app`
I created a json file that contains the Derby City Drip Coffee Shop menu items divided into groups: Coffee, Non-Coffee, Tea, and Pastry.

`2. Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file   *You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted`

 
`3. Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application`
Each group of menu items (Coffee, Non-Cofee, Tea, and Pastry) are setup as an array in the menu.json file. I used fetch() to grab each array from the menu.json file and display the data as individual menu items in html on the web page. 

## Additional Javascript Feature
`Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS`
